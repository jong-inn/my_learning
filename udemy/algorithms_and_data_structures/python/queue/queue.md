## __Queue__
<br>

### __1) Overview and Characteristics__
<br>

* It is an abstract data type and it can be implemented either with arrays or with linked lists

* FIFO structure â€“ the first item we inserted is the first item we take out

* Basic operations are enqueue, dequeue, and peek

* Graph algorithms rely heavily on queues such as breadth-first search can be implemented with queues

<br>

### __2) Applications__
<br>

* Threads are stored in queues

* Queues are important in CPU scheduling - when data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at the same rate as sent) between two processes
